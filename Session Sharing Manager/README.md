SmartInternetEvolution-SSM-Session-Sharing-Manager-
===================================================

This is a sub project within  a major project called smart internet evolution which targets to renovate the whole protocol stack within  a framework. The submodule is called Session Sharing Manager which aims to share the entire session from one device to another in the same network and gives seamless service to all devices. The project provides streaming of media(audio + video) from one device to another and then the routing protocol routs the stream to multiple devices within the same network. The efficient part of the project is that instead of downloading and transfer the whole session is just transferred. The project utilizes Avahi(Linux) for automatic discovery of the devices in the network and then authenticates them in case of service delivery(media streaming).The project also utilizes Gstreamer (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GStreamer) to implement the functionality and concludes with a tutorial on gstreamer and a technical report spanning the entire project.
